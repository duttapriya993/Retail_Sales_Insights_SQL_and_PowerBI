## ✅ Project Overview
This project combines **SQL for data preparation and exploratory analysis** with **Power BI for interactive visualization** to uncover key sales drivers, category performance, and discount impact on profitability.  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data cleaning, data type fixes, null checks, and EDA queries  
- **Power BI** – KPI visuals, category breakdown, regional analysis, and dynamic filters  
- **DAX** – Calculated measures for profit margins and discount impact  

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **customers.csv** – Customer details (region, segment, city, etc.)  
- **orders.csv** – Transaction details (sales, quantity, profit, discount)  
- **products.csv** – Product information (category, sub-category)  

---

## 🔧 Data Preparation Workflow
- Created `RetailSQLProject` database and imported 3 datasets  
- Cleaned and standardized data types (sales, discount, profit → decimals)  
- Checked for null values across all tables  
- Built SQL queries for:
  - Monthly sales trend  
  - Region-wise and segment-wise performance  
  - Profitability by category and sub-category  
  - Impact of high discounts on profit
